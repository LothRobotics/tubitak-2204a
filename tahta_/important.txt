Notes for developing & releasing new versions

dont put data folder or any data files with the actual github release
we will actually create a seperate version with those folders for distribution to schools

when creating the distribution zip, choose all the files in the dist/tahta4 
folder and say add to archive, then choose zip compression type
and compress it

ALSO: Make sure to change the version.json file as well as change every value in data.json to "None"
