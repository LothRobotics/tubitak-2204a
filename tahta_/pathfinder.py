# Create a set sptSet (shortest path tree set) that keeps track of vertices included in the shortest-path tree, i.e., 
# whose minimum distance from the source is calculated and finalized. Initially, this set is empty. 
# Assign a distance value to all vertices in the input graph. Initialize all distance values as INFINITE. 
# Assign the distance value as 0 for the source vertex so that it is picked first. 
# While sptSet doesnâ€™t include all vertices 
#     Pick a vertex u which is not there in sptSet and has a minimum distance value. 
#     Include u to sptSet. 
#     Then update distance value of all adjacent vertices of u. 
#         To update the distance values, iterate through all adjacent vertices. 
#         For every adjacent vertex v, if the sum of the distance value of u (from source) and weight of edge u-v, is less than the distance value
#         of v, then update the distance value of v. 

# Note: We use a boolean array sptSet[] to represent the set of vertices included in SPT. If a value sptSet[v] is true, then vertex v 
# is included in SPT, otherwise not. Array dist[] is used to store the shortest distance values of all vertices.
